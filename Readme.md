Overview
--------
This is an application which shows how Form.io can be used as a **Human Resources Portal** platform. This allows administrators (HR personel) to create their own forms needed for their department. 
 
In addition, it also allows employees to login, submit those forms, and then have access to their data that they submitted within their forms.
